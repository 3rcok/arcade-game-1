Students should use this rubric: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3072588797

for self-checking their submission.


Update due to the project being returned for:
No README file is included or the file is incomplete.
Required: Assume that the player who finds your github has no technical knowledge. How
would they access your game?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
... really? someone with "no technical knowledge" is trying to access my game on github? 
At some point you have to make assumptions of your target audience. In this case if you 
need the to reference a read me file you would not be the target audience. Without these
assumptions things could easily get out of hand.

lol, ok here it is!
